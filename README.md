# Genomic clustering facilitates nuclear processing of suboptimal pri-miRNA loci

## Aim
- To see whether assisted processing found in mir-144~451 cluster would be extended to other subpotimal pri-miRNA loci

## Description
- SHAPE library was generated by Boseon Kim
- *In vitro* DROSHA processing library was generated by Kijun Kim
- Raw SHAPE and *in vitro* processing data that was used in jupyter notebook are yet to be uploaded because they will be reported separately

## Contents
1. Load pri-miRNA informations
2. Encode SHAPE structures
3. Extract structural features (loop size & UGU)
4. Compare pairing probability between *in silico* & SHAPE structures
5. Calculate processing efficiency
6. Compare processing efficiency between optimal and suboptimal pri-miRNAs
7. Parse miRNA annotation file to read miRNA clustering information
8. Compare miRNA clustering between optimal and suboptimal pri-miRNAs
9. Compare processing efficiency between (subopimal & clustered) and (suboptimal & not-clustered)
